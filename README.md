# Welcome
Welcome to my ISYS17004 website project. This website was developed using the CakePHP framework which follows an MVC structure. The website is fully funstional with error handling in place and the ability to have different levels of user accounts such as an admin account. 

# Getting started
I heavily implore you to look through the source code and view my work, I have left comments in my:
- Models
- Controllers
- View files
- CSS files 
- JavaScript files

If you wish you explore and use the website for yourself then copy the HotelWebsite directory into a XAMPP htdocs folder, then open a terminal within the HotelWebsite directory and run the command `composer install` if you have composer already installed on your machiene. 
The last step is to enable the `intl` extension from `php.ini` and then you can run the apache web server and make an account. 

Please note that if you create an account it will only be a user account. If you wish to exmplore the admin section then use the premade admin account:
- Username `admin@test.com`
- Password `test`
